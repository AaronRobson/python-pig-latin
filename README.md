# python-pig-latin

Translate text into Pig Latin using Python

## details

This script strips out any non-alpha or single space characters, converts everything to lowercase, and then translates into Pig Latin. Words that start with consonants are translated by moving all consonants before the first vowel to the end of the word. So, for example, "the" becomes "ethay" not "hetay".
